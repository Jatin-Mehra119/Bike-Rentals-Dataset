# Bike Rentals Optimization

## Overview
- **Objective**: Optimize bike rentals to ensure smooth availability during peak hours and days.
- **Data Source**: Publicly available data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Repository Contents
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Scripts for cleaning and transforming the raw data.
- **Model Training**:
  - Scripts for training machine learning models and saving their metrics.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Jupyter Notebook (`Notebook.ipynb`) for visualizing the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Includes brief points and observations based on visualizations.
- **Feature Importance**:
  - Extracted feature importances using trained models.
- **Output**:
  - `output.txt`: Contains results from the `main.py` script.

## Usage
1. **Use main.py script**:
   - This script will automatically preprocess the data and train the model, save the model and test metrics using preprocessing.py and train.py. 
2. **Visualize the Data**:
   - Open and run the `Notebook.ipynb` to explore the data and model performance visually.

## Observations
- Detailed observations and insights are documented within `Notebook.ipynb`.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts and notebooks.
- The models and metrics are saved for easy retrieval and analysis.
